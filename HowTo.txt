This document will explain how to use TriAL-QL engine which was implemented as part of the Master Thesis: 
"A Scalable Engine for TriAL-QL on SQL-on-Hadoop" at the University of Freiburg in 2016.

There are two possibilities of TriAL-QL Engine execution:
1. Impala Engine - AppImpala.java class
2. Spark Engine - AppSpark.java class

1. When using the Impala Execution:
Use class AppImpala.java from executor module, with 2 inline arguments. First argument can be a TriAL-QL query, or a flag "-f" which
tells that we are giving a file path. If the second case, the file with the TriAL-QL queries resides in path which is given as the
second inline argument.

2. When using the Spark Execution:
Use class AppSpark.java from executor module with 3 inline arguments. First argument can be a TriAL-QL query, or a flag "-f" which tells
that we are giving a file path. If the second case, the file with the TriAL-QL queries resides in path which is given as the second
inline argument. The third  inline argument is a shuffle.partition number, which is used as a configuration to JavaSparkContext.

In addition, one can use configuration class which resides in data.structures module named Configuration.class. The configuration
parameters that can be used include:

	1. initialTableName - Initial table name (only for Spark)
	
	2. compositeJoin** = false; - Use composite execution mode. To be combined with configuration 3.
	
	3. noFixedPoint = false; - Use fixed point executor for joins in composite mode. To be combined with configuration 2.
	
	4. SemNaive* = true; - Use Semi-naive algorithm for recursive queries.
	
	5. Smart* = false; - Use Scalable Smart algorithm for recursive queries.
	
	6. Heuristics* = false; - Use Heuristic Naive algorithm for recursive queries.
	
	7. compositionalConnectivity = false; - Use Compositional Semi-naive algorithm for Connectivity Pattern, if false use the
	default non-compositional algorithm.
		
	8. longChainRecursion = false; - Only for Spark execution with Semi-Naive or Scalable Smart recursive queries, to be used	
	to be used for long chain recursions.
		
	9. saveToFiles = false; - Save the final results to local file system.
	
	10. impalaConnUrl*** - This settings is found in class ImpalaDaemon.java. Here we set the connection URL to Impala Master. (only
	for Impala) 
	
	
*   Only one of configuration 4, 5, 6 should be on at the same time for recursive queries
**  Composite mode works only for non-recursive queries
*** This configuration resides in module executor, class ImpalaDaemon.java

--- NOTE: In order to run the code one should also include atlr4-runtime binary version 4.5
